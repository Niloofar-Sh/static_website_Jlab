You can use the pip command to install all the packages listed in a requirements.txt file. Here are the steps to do so:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the requirements.txt file is located.

Run the following command to install all the packages listed in the file:

pip install -r requirements.txt


This command tells pip to install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Wait for the packages to be installed. This may take some time depending on the number of packages and their size.

Once the installation is complete, you should be able to use the installed packages in the Jupyter Notebook.
